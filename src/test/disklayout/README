You cannot technically run this on the build machine, because you won't
get the correct platform node and modules.

If you insist on trying on the build machine, first do:

# mount -o ro -O -F lofs src/node_modules/disklayout.js /usr/node/0.10/node_modules/disklayout.js

The 'run' script will run all of the tests.
